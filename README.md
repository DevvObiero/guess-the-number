Guess the Number Game
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Guess the Number Game, an interactive, terminal-based game designed to provide endless fun with numbers. Developed using Python, this game challenges players to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts. It's a test of logic, intuition, and a sprinkle of luck.

🎯 Game Features
Intuitive Gameplay: Players will guess a number within a specified range, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Difficulty Levels: The game offers multiple difficulty levels, adjusting the range of possible numbers and the number of attempts based on the level chosen.
Score Tracking: Keep track of how many attempts it takes to guess the number correctly, with lower scores indicating more efficient guessing.
